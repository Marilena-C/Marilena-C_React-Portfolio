      Hi everyone and welcome to my portfolio page :-)

My name is Marilena and I am studying Fron-End Web Development and User Experience through the Skills Bootcamp run by University of Birmingham and edx.


I have done a couple of projects which helped me understand the basics of HTML and CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and React and I can't wait to learn more and improve my skills.
